This project is a single page web game: a Super Mario clone where the main character is a soccer ball and enemies are orange practice cones. Controls: left/right arrow keys to move, space to jump. Enemies are defeated by jumping on them; touching them otherwise resets the level. Levels are procedurally generated with random enemies and holes.
